### part 5: Mistakes I made

Failed twice

# Mistake 1: shift strategies for a free exam

2017 summer - started INE workbook
2018 Feb - approved Cisco Live, switched from workbook (halfway) to preparing written
2018 June - 1st written fail
2018 July - 2nd written fail
2019 Jan - Written pass

- Cisco Live exams for re-certs or tracks you're considering

# Mistake 2: pre-mature retake for attempt 2

# Mistake 3: better focus on learning methods and memorization

# Mistake 4: steadfast time management during exam
90 questions instead of 100 or 110
almost ran out of time
looked down and had 22 minutes with 25 questions to go
3rd quartile
4th quartile, ended with 5 seconds left
