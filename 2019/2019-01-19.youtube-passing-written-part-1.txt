    # series breakdown
        part 1: intro, strategy, planning
        part 2: learning to learn

        part 4: Evolving Technologies for CCIE/CCDE
        part 5: Mistakes to avoid
        part 6: execute the plan

    # caveats
        my experience, but you have to own it
        v5.1, evolving technologies v1.1
        score 806
        have not yet attempted lab
        limited work experience with several protocols
        Not a spring chicken anymore

    # strategy first, general methods
        Pick your poison (first-timers)
            Prepare for written, worry about lab later
            Prepare for lab, circle back to written
        My advice depends, mainly on experience level
            Evaluate yourself with blueprints
            Seek advice of mentor who knows your work
            materials talk about courses that have intro
        You have to decide, the right way gets you that number
            Either way, must know the blueprint for each

    # project planning
        time
        communications
        budget

    # plan your work, work your plan
        this series applies to written, but ...
