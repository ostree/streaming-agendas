How to pass the CCIE RS written exam

# two videos to cover the last written attempt

# caveats to this information
    v5.1, evolving technologies v1.1
    score 806
    have not yet attempted lab
    limited work experience with several protocols
    Not a spring chicken anymore

# how to pass? basically ... learn all the things
    deep learning, no shortcuts
    need to retain large amounts of information
    focus on how you learn and what works best

# own the blueprint
    at expert level, no one source of information
    must be knowledgeable of each level
    you are ultimately responsible for knowing the topic to depth required
    CCNA/P easy to 'adhere to vendor lesson plan'
    understand, then memorize
        understand
            dig as deep as you need to
            go down a rabbit hole if you have to, e.g. ASBR LSAs

# grind
    no magic unlock key here, folks
    time
    energy
    money
    patience/understanding from family and friends

# original plan
    2 general methods
        - Prepare for written, not the lab
        - Prepare for lab, then take written
    Reading
    Study for lab exam, lab through INE workbook
    Go back and study written material
    Take written exam
    Advanced lab preparations
    Lab exam

# materials I used
    # labbing
        INE ATC videos and workbook
            Don't recommend doing much labbing just for sake of written topics

    # video courses
    INE Written video course
        Good introduction to material and some advice
        Good practice question videos
    networklessons.com CCIE written course
        Broadest topic coverage of all other courses
        good explanations, visual teacher
        videos, labs, captures
    Pluralsight videos for MPLS & BGP (Joe Astorino)
        Good intro to BGP and MPBGP
    
    # review/practice
    Boson written practice exam
        500 questions
        Pinpoint your knowledge gaps
        Excellent links to Cisco docs (when Cisco hasn't moved them)
        Some information is out-of-date
    cciein8weeks
        good summaries
        good for final review or just 'another take'
    
    # reading
        Books
        Nicholas Russo's evolving technologies guide

# what would I do differently?
    stick to original plan
    2nd attempt was wasted
    more flash cards!

# miscellany
    time management
        90 questions instead of 100 or 110
        almost ran out of time
            looked down and had 22 minutes with 25 questions to go
            3rd quartile
            4th quartile, ended with 5 seconds left
