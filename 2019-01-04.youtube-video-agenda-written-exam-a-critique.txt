Honest feedback on the CCIE RS written exam

# INTRO
my experience with written exam
    v5.1, evolving technologies 1.0
        2 attempts
    v5.1, evolving technologies 1.1
        1 attempt

# THE GOOD
    PearsonVue facility, New Horizons
        automatic reschedule
        accessible
        quiet, professional 'congratulations'
        multiple laminated sheets
            didn't use, but glad they were there
    Price is reasonable
        happily pay more, though
    Many questions were very fair
        appropriate difficulty level
        even after 3 attempts, expect few repeats
        love getting immediate response
    Blueprint as a guide

# THE BAD
- what is being tested?
    ye ole' trivia complaint
    test-taking intelligence vs protocol knowledge
    acronyms that is not listed on the blueprint
    question 'keywords'

- Cisco.com documentation shortcomings

# THE UGLY
- evolving technologies
    blueprint is too broad
    ocg is great material, why not reference that
    smells of sales

- feedback system
    no practical way to provide feedback
    don't ask me to comment on specific questions with a time penalty
        - submitted last question with 5 seconds left
