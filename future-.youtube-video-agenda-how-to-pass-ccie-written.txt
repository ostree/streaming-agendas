How to pass the CCIE RS written exam video series

# part 1: introduction, general strategy
    #   intro and caveats
        v5.1, evolving technologies v1.1
        score 806
        have not yet attempted lab
        limited work experience with several protocols
        Not a spring chicken anymore

    2 strategy first, general methods
        Blueprint review
        Prepare for written, not the lab
        Prepare for lab, then take written
        Depends on:
            re-take or first attempt
            experience level
        You have to decide, the right way gets you that number
            Either way, must know the blueprint for each

    project planning
        time
        communications
        budget

    plan your work, work your plan
    this series applies to written, but ...

    my original plan
        Reading
        Study for lab exam, lab through INE workbook
        Go back and study written material
        Take written exam
        Advanced lab preparations
        Lab exam

# part 2: learning to learn

    focus on how you learn and what works best

    Phase 1 (concepts): learn and understand the technology [diffuse mode]
        # how to pass? basically ... learn all the things
            two phases
            foundation
            CCIE doing retake vs not yet passed

        # what to learn? own the blueprint
            at expert level, no one source of information
            must be knowledgeable of each level
            you are ultimately responsible for knowing the topic to depth required
            CCNA/P easy to 'adhere to vendor lesson plan'
            understand first, memorize later
        # concepts
            'be the salesperson'
                why is this needed?
                when should/shouldn't be used?
            how does it compare/contrast with other solutions
            dig as deep as you need to
                go down a rabbit hole if you have to, e.g. ASBR LSAs

    Phase 2 (trivial pursuit): [focus mode]
        trivial pursuit analogy
        deep learning, no shortcuts
        need to retain large amounts of information
        find gaps from phase 1
            testing
            go back as needed
        add details
        reinforce and retain knowledge
        review, review, review

    A few words about note-taking
        Concept-phase
            Mind mapping
            drawings
            drill sheet
        Trivia phase
            Drill sheet
            Flash cards

# part 3: materials

    CONCEPT PHASE
    # labbing (depending on strategy chosen)
        INE ATC videos and workbook
            Don't recommend doing much labbing just for sake of written topics
    # video courses
        INE Written video course
            Good introduction to material and some advice
            Good practice question videos
        networklessons.com CCIE written course
            Broadest topic coverage of all other courses
            good explanations, visual teacher
            videos, labs, captures
        Pluralsight videos for MPLS & BGP (Joe Astorino)
            Good intro to BGP and MPBGP

# part 5: Mistakes to avoid
    # what would I do differently?

    2015 Jan - Obtained CCNP
    2015 summer - started reading
    2016-2017 - life things (dating, move different state)
    2017 summer - started INE workbook
    2018 Feb - booked for Cisco Live, switched from workbook to preparing written
    2018 June - 1st written fail
    2018 July - 2nd written fail
    2019 Jan - Written pass

    stick to original plan
    2nd attempt was wasted

    time management
        90 questions instead of 100 or 110
        almost ran out of time
            looked down and had 22 minutes with 25 questions to go
            3rd quartile
            4th quartile, ended with 5 seconds left


# part 6: execute the plan

    # grind
        no magic unlock key here, folks
        time
        energy
