# part 2: learning to learn

# how hard is it?
    don't underestimate difficulty
        this exam dares you
        check pride at door

    - a 'CCNP plus'
    - something to get out of way before lab
    - juts an IQ filter

    don't disrespect it
        eat you for breakfast and spit you out
        mock you

# how do I pass?
    learn all the things 
    no shortcuts, no substitutes
    no silver bullet in this series
    need to retain large amounts of information
    tremendous breadth and width
        - tactics that worked for lower level exams not enough
        - most challenging exam in my career
    before diving in, evaluate learning process
    focus on how you learn and what works best
    merits time up front
    review some material on subject:

    Two phases: conceptual and trivial

# what to learn? 
    at expert level, no one source of information
        major difference with CCNP
    own the blueprint
    you are ultimately responsible for knowing the topic to depth
    can't afford to skip (own mind will betray you!)

# Phase 1 (concepts / diffuse mode): 
    learn and understand the technology
        'be the salesperson'
            why is this needed?
            when should/shouldn't be used?
            how does it compare/contrast with other solutions
            what are mechanics?
    when you get stuck
        dig as deep as you need to (do whatever it takes)
        repitition
        tenacious attitude
            prepare for disappointment in materials
            eliminate any traces of entitlement
            scour as needed
            RFCs anyone?
            
# Phase 2 (trivial pursuit / focus mode)
    trivial pursuit analogy
    find gaps from phase 1
        testing
        go back as needed
    add details
    reinforce and retain knowledge
    review, review, review

# Learning tools
    Different for everyone (notes example)
    Conceptualization
        Mind mapping
        drawings
    Details
        Drill sheet
        Flash cards
