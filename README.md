# thelantamer-streaming-agendas

This repo is where I will start keeping all streaming agendas, which includes topics discussed on each stream and LOTD (Links of the Day).

For viewers, these repos can by synced and referenced during a stream to follow along with any links.

It's useful as a streamer, because these agendas are used for youtube uploads and come in handy when trying to remember specific links associated with topics covered in the stream.
